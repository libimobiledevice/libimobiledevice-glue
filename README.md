# libimobiledevice-glue

Library with common code used by the libraries and tools around the
**libimobiledevice** project.

![](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice-glue/workflows/build/badge.svg)

## Features

The main functionality provided by this library are **socket** helper
functions and a platform independent **thread/mutex** implementation.
Besides that it comes with a number of string, file, and plist helper
functions, as well as some other commonly used code that was originally
duplicated in the dedicated projects.

Test on Linux, macOS, Windows.

## Projects using this library

- [libusbmuxd](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libusbmuxd)
- [libimobiledevice](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice)
- [usbmuxd](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/usbmuxd)
- [libirecovery](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libirecovery)

## Installation / Getting started

### Debian / Ubuntu Linux

First install all required dependencies and build tools:
```shell
sudo apt-get install \
	build-essential \
	checkinstall \
	git \
	autoconf \
	automake \
	libtool-bin \
	libplist-dev \
	pkg-config \
```

Then clone the actual project repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice-glue.git
cd libimobiledevice-glue
```

Now you can build and install it:
```shell
./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install
```

If you require a custom prefix or other option being passed to `./configure`
you can pass them directly to `./autogen.sh` like this:
```bash
./autogen.sh --prefix=/opt/local
make
sudo make install
```

## Usage

This library is directly used by libusbmuxd, libimobiledevice, etc., so there
is no need to do anything in particular.
